                <h2>Senator Mike Gravel is considering seeking the Democratic nomination for president of these United States.</h2>
                <p>Mike Gravel represented Alaska in the U.S. Senate as a Democrat from 1969 to 1981. In 1971, he gained attention for reading the Pentagon Papers into the Congressional Record, risking expulsion from the Senate in doing so. He led the charge in normalizing relations with China and was a leading opponent of the Vietnam War, playing a pivotal role in helping end the draft.</p>
                <p>Since leaving the Senate, he has focused on anti-war and pro-political reform advocacy, attracting national attention for his run in 2008. During his campaign, he pre-empted other major politicians in his progressivism: he was an early supporter of abolishing capital punishment, ending the War on Drugs, and legalizing same-sex marriage. Since 2014, he has served as CEO of two companies in the legal cannabis market.</p>
                
                <p>Sen. Gravel is committed to ending America's imperial policies (especially in Venezuela and Iran), rescheduling cannabis, fundamentally reforming our politics through direct democracy, abolishing mass surveillance on American citizens, prioritizing climate change, dismantling America's carceral state, and building a foreign policy free of undue influence by Israel and Saudi Arabia.</p>
                
                <p>If he were to run, he would aim not to win, but instead to qualify for the 2020 Democratic debates in order to send a message that no other candidate, not even Bernie Sanders or Tulsi Gabbard is willing to issue. Our goal is to push the rest of the Democratic field toward policies, especially on political reform, climate change, and foreign policy, that, for the first time in decades, will truly challenge the American plutocracy and military-industrial complex.</p>

                <h2 id="why">Why Mike Gravel?</h2>

                "Why should I help Sen. Gravel when there are other leftist candidates (with more recent service) in the race?"

                <p>We're not asking for your vote, and we're not planning on contesting any primaries. We're seeking to reach 65,000 donors, qualify for the Democratic debates, and use that platform to issue a critique of American militarism, plutocracy, and inaction on climate. Sen. Gravel is willing to leverage the national stage such a moment would give to say what establishment candidates won't, whether on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, the Saudi-led mass murder in Yemen, or the need to immediately end the War on Drugs.</p>

                <p>Unlike every time-server and grifter in the Democratic race, Sen. Gravel has done significant things for this country. The son of immigrants, Sen. Gravel served as a first lieutenant in the Army before earning his B.S. in Economics from Columbia University. He moved to Alaska, absolutely broke, and in 12 years was elected to represent it in the U.S. Senate. In the Senate, he gained attention for his steadfast opposition to the war in Vietnam. He filibustered draft legislation during the Vietnam War, attempting to end it; read the Pentagon Papers into the public record, at tremendous risk to himself; urged the normalization of relations with China; and supported the Inuit community. After leaving the Senate in 1981, Sen. Gravel lobbied for direct democracy and against war, also serving as the CEO of a marijuana company.</p>
                
                <p>By no means is Sen. Gravel perfect. He's made votes he regrets deeply; he's declared bankruptcy due to the cost of medical procedures; his career in public service has had its share of missteps. The <i>New York Times</i>' profile of Sen. Gravel declared him <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/02/archives/impetuous-senator-maurice-robert-gravel.html">"tenacious, persevering and very stubborn...inclined to extremes and to impulsive actions."</a> But Sen. Gravel, like the Biblical prophet Jeremiah, cares deeply about this country, deeply enough to criticize its excesses. Sen. Gravel is a true progressive.</p>
                
                <p>And that's important in a Democratic field peppered with false progressives. As attorney general of California, Kamala Harris <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/08/kamala-harris-trump-obama-california-attorney-general">defended the death penalty</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/kamala-harris-criminal-justice.html">helped keep innocent men like Kevin Cooper on death row</a>. Cory Booker (so eager to appear an everyman he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/cory-booker-wants-be-nicest-democrat-running-president-his-own-ncna966596"> invented a drug dealer friend named "T-Bone"</a>) voted <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/01/12/cory-booker-joins-senate-republicans-to-kill-measure-to-import-cheaper-medicine-from-canada/">against a bill letting Americans import drugs from Canada</a> and is <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/02/cory-booker-charters-public-schools-president">an obsessive enemy of public schooling</a>. And don't even get us started on Joe Biden, who (in addition to the <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/10/biden-thinks-its-unfair-for-anita-hill-to-blame-him-report.html">Anita Hill debacle</a>) <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/01/the-case-against-joe-biden.html">voted for the Iraq War</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/joe-biden-integration-school-busing-120968">opposed racial integration in the 1970s</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/us/politics/joe-bidens-role-in-90s-crime-law-could-haunt-any-presidential-bid.html">led the charge for mass incarceration in the 1990s</a>.</p>
                
                <p>We're not saying any Democratic candidate must have a clean-as-snow record, but these checkered pasts show that what any candidate needs is a strong, vocal, active left flank. And that's the service Sen. Gravel would render: to pressure the other candidates into adopting views more in line with the reality our nation faces. Sen. Gravel's presence will expand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">Overton window</a> in the Democratic Party, pushing the dialogue leftward and encouraging candidates like Bernie Sanders to focus more on ending American imperialism, addressing the climate crisis, and fundamentally reforming our politics as integral parts of the progressive agenda.</p>
                
                <p>After getting in the first two debates and issuing the all-important critique of our destructive American empire, Sen. Gravel would leave the race and endorse the frontrunner among progressive Democrats. The Sen. Gravel campaign would be unlike any other: it would truly be of the people and for the people. It would do its utmost to tear the veil off the bloody machinery of the American military-industrial complex. It would bring other candidates to task for their dirty dealings and unethical actions. It would talk about just how broken American politics is, and how we can fix it. <i>That is why you should support a Gravel 2020 campaign</i>.</p>
